# ðŸš€ Future Prep Deployment Guide

## GitHub Repository Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `future-prep`
3. Description: `Future Prep - Comprehensive SAT/ACT/AP resources, scholarships, and research opportunities for high school students`
4. Make it **Public**
5. **DON'T** check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# You're already in the right directory (/Users/rayaz/future-prep)
git remote add origin https://github.com/RayAzhari/future-prep.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials:
- **Username**: `RayAzhari`
- **Password**: Use your GitHub Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

If you don't have a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with "repo" permissions
3. Use that token as your password
